# 5DayGeostats_DataAnalytics
5-day course on Geostatistics, Data Analytics and Machine Learning

Short course on data analytics, geostatistics and machine learning with lectures, and hands-on demos for a 5-day class.

#### Course Objectives:

You will gain:
* knowledge concerning data analytics, geostatistics and machine learning
* theory to improve your understanding
* practical workflows to improve your impact

#### Course Agenda
* Introduction: objectives, plan
* Modeling Prerequisites - subsurface modeling goals and workflows, probability, statistics etc.
* Spatial Estimation – stationarity, variogram calculation, trend modeling, kriging estimation 
* Spatial Uncertainty - building spatial uncertainty models  
* Multivariate Analysis – correlation, marginal, conditional and joint, cosimulation, and machine learning
* Novel Worklfows - summary of emerging areas of interest                
* Conclusion – summary, lessons learned, discussion

#### The Instructor:

### Michael Pyrcz, Associate Professor, University of Texas at Austin

#### Want to Work Together?

I hope that this is helpful to those that want to learn more about subsurface modeling, data analytics and machine learning. Students and working professionals are welcome to participate.

* Want to invite me to visit your company for training, mentoring, project review, workflow design and consulting, I'd be happy to drop by and work with you! 

* Interested in partnering, supporting my graduate student research or my Subsurface Data Analytics and Machine Learning consortium (co-PIs including Profs. Foster, Torres-Verdin and van Oort)? My research combines data analytics, stochastic modeling and machine learning theory with practice to develop novel methods and workflows to add value. We are solving challenging subsurface problems!
